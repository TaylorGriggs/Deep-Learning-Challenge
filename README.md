# Deep-Learning-Challenge
## Overview
In this challenge I was tasked to utilize and optimize a deep learning model from the given prompt: The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, you have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization.

## Requirements 
- Reprocess the Data
- Compile, Train and Evaluate the Model
- Optimize the Model
- Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

## Results
### Data Preprocession
#### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- Target variable(s) for the model: The target variable for the model is IS_SUCCESSFUL.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
